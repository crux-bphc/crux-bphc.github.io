# Constitution

## Preamble

It is important to recognize the danger that bureaucracy can get in the way of doing cool things. This constitution is an attempt to provide the means to ensure that the club can run smoothly and it should be invoked in compliance with the spirit of the club.

## Article 1: Club Name and Purpose

### 1: Name

The club name has not been finalised yet, so, as a placeholder, the name *foss@bphc* will be used in all documents referring to the club. If and when a permanent name has been decided, this section shall be amended.

### 2: Purpose

The purpose of foss@bphc is to write and advocate free software, and to create a community of excellent programmers.

The club shall take no 'official' stance on political debates among the open source community, and shall not place any constraints on the type of project and/or tools used to accomplish the tasks by the members, as long as the project worked on by members of the club, under the flag of the club, and distributed by the club should meet some acceptable definition of open source software.

## Article 2: Membership

The club has three main types of memberships to offer:

### 1. Active Membership

Active Membership is the default membership offered by the induction process to the student body of Bits Pilani Hyderabad Campus.

If for some reason a member is unable to fulfill one of the above expectations, they are required to intimate at least one core member in advance of the problem.

#### 3. Removal

Active members get three credits each semester. Failure to comply with the expectations would lead to deduction of one credit for each such event. If a member's credits reach 0, they shall be removed from the club.

Should another cause for membership removal be raised, a member can be removed by a two thrids majority vote of Core Members, providing there is at least a week's notice of the vote.
