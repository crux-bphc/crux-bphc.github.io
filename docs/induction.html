		<h1>FOSS@BPHC Induction</h1>
		<p>Inspired by the Foss@Amrita, we have begun a BPHC version of FOSS andd we are now inducting members. Unlike most other clubs, this club needs more than a little commitment from you and to test if you have what it takes, the induction challenge has been described below.</p>
		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>Create a program/script in your favorite programming language to perform the following tasks:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Parse a youtube "playlist" page to extract links of all videos in the playlist into a file.</li>
			<li>One by one download all the videos to a folder.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Rules</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Should be a command line program.</li>
			<li>Cross platform compatibility is not required.</li>
			<li>At first run, provide option for setting the downloads folder.</li>
			<li>The code should be under 200 lines.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Tips</h2>
		<p>You can use any programming language you want, but as an example, I'll list out some of them here:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
			<li>Bash Scripting</li>
			<li>C++</li>
			<li>Java</li>
		</ol>
		<p>With that out of the way, you are also free to utilize any modules or plugins available for your language/OS of choice. If you do so, you should also provide a small installation script to handle that installation. An example of a small installation script could be:</p>
		<pre><code>
#! /usr/bin/env bash
# install a package you need for your project.
sudo apt-get install my-dependency -y
# Supposing you used nodejs, let's install all your node dependencies with this command.
sudo npm install
echo "Installation successful. You may now run the project."
		</code></pre>
		<h2>Marking Scheme</h2>
		<p>Out of 100 marks, the division will be as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>50 marks for a working program.</li>
			<li>10 marks for well written code. (covers indentation, descriptive variable names, comments, etc.)</li>
			<li>10 marks for providing the ability to continue downloads if once interupted.</li>
			<li>10 marks for a good installation script/instructions. If you have a stand alone program, you by default get 10.</li>
			<li>20 marks for additional features and creativity and adherence with the 200 lines of code limit.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Submission</h1>
		<p>Submit your assigments by either:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Creating a Github/Gitlab repository and sending the link. (preferred)</li>
			<li>Creating a zip file with all the code and sending the file.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Email the assignments to aero31aero@gmail.com before 11 PM on 8th November, 2016. We will interview the top 15 people on the basis of the rank list. Good luck!</p>
