<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Winter of Code program is an annual coding event over the winter vacations for the members inducted in the foss@bphc society. Each member will be assigned a mentor who will take care of guiding the mentee through the nuances of developing good quality software.</p>
<p>The project can be chosen at the member&#39;s discretion, and can use any library or API of their choice. Members can choose to either work individually or in teams of two.</p>
<p>Each member will have to submit an initial draft of the proposal to at least one of the prospective mentors (Arnav Dhamija, Kumar Prasun, Nischay Pro, Rohitt Vashishtha) on Telegram or Facebook, by <strong>1 December 2016, 11pm</strong>. Following this, projects must be finalised by <strong>15 December 2016</strong>.</p>
<p>It is recommended to keep proposals short and to the point. A template for a proposal for the Winter of Code is given below.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-template">Proposal Template</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In this section, give a brief overview of the project you want to make and why you want to work on it.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>Mention how you plan to implement your project and include details such as programming languages you plan to use, which libraries and APIs, and which platform(s) you aim to develop for.</p>
<h3 id="mockups-optional-">Mockups (Optional)</h3>
<p>In case you feel your project idea is better explained through images, you may link to visual mockups of your project idea. For GUIs, a good tool for making mockups is <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>.</p>
<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<p>Here, you should describe a plan for your project and set milestones for points in your project development. As you will have 3-4 weeks till the next semester starts, you would want to plan your project around this with a plan for what you will accomplish each week in your project.</p>
<h3 id="about-me-miscellaneous-details">About Me / Miscellaneous Details</h3>
<p>This section can be used for any details you feel don&#39;t fit in the previous sections. You can mention your preferred working hours and any events (such as holiday plans) due to which you might need to take a break from coding. This will help your mentor in co-ordinating with you.</p>
